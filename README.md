```

## Connect to the YouTube Api

1. Enable the [YouTube Data API v3](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?authuser=1&project=yt-search-replace&supportedpurview=project&q=youtube)
2. Create a new PROJECT, I called mine yt-find-replace
3. Visit `APIs & Services > Credentials > Create credentials`, and generate a OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
Select `Desktop App` as the Application type.
Download it, rename it to `oauth_client.json`, and save it in the root of this repo.
It should look something like this:

    ``` json
    {
      "installed": {
        "client_id": "123456.googleusercontent.com",
        "project_id": "xxx-123",
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_secret": "123456",
        "redirect_uris": [
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

4. You should also set up the OAuth consent screen, leave it as "testing", and add your YouTube email to the test users.
5. Create a new Service Account key from `IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Keys`,
rename it as `client_secrets.json` and save it in the root of this repo.  It should look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "xxx-123",
      "private_key_id": "123456",
      "private_key": "-----PRIVATE KEY-----",
      "client_email": "gspread@email.access",
      "client_id": "123456",
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/"
    }
    ```

## Running the project

**If you are running in a production environment, be sure to change/remove this line:**

```python
os.environ["OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT"] = "1"
```

Then run the project:

```shell
python ./main.py
```

It will ask for your find/replace inputs.  For example:

```shell
$ Find: We are fundraising for The Trevor Project from April 1, 2021 - June 30, 2021.
$ Replace: We are fundraising for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention from July 1, 2021 - September 30, 2021.
```

You will be asked to visit a URL to authorize the application.  Follow the steps to get the authorization code, and hit enter to continue.  After some time, you should see **"Done! thanks."**

The changes should appear on the video page, but it takes a while to update in YouTube Studio.

Have fun!
